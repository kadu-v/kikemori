# Products

I love the low level programming, such as OS, Compiler and FPGA.

## GUI for an eEmbedded OS of Raspberry Pi

I extended an embeded os for raspberry pi with GUI (i.e., frame buffer).
I am planing to extend it with more features.
If you are interested in my project, Please check [here](https://github.com/kadu-v/krust-raspberry-os).

## Chisel to Tetris

I'm trying to implement a [Hack PC](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) by a Chisel that is a Scala DSL to implement degital circuits instead of using a Verilog HDL.
If you are interested in my project, Please check the follwing materials:

- [Hack CPU in Chisel](https://github.com/nishi-7/ChiselHackCPU).
- [Hack Assembler in Scala](git@github.com:nishi-7/Assembler.git)

## Rust on FPGA

When I worked in Nefrock inc., I implemented a bare metal application in Rust for the speech-to-speech edge-AI on Xilinx FPGA.
If you are interested in this project, Please check the follwing materials:

- [Website about the speech-to-speech edge-AI](https://www.nefrock.com/ja/news/2022-10-20)
- [Rust bindings of Xilinx bsp](https://github.com/nefrock/embeddedsw-rs)
- [Presentation in FPGAX#13 (youtube, japanese)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkanIDrHcGY&t=3737s)

## monkye-rs

I implemented an interpreter of [monkey language](https://monkeylang.org/).
This interpreter can report user freindly error messeages.
